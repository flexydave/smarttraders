                    <span>SMART TRADERS TECHNOLOGIES</span>  has developed a procedure for the prompt attention to the grievances of
                    its customers with respect to various issues by setting up a “customer support” and “a dispute 
                    resolution mechanism”. The following are the foundational principles of this policy:

            </div>

                   
            <div class="mini">
                    <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;"> TRANSPARENCY:</span> <br><br>
                    Prompt, courteous and timeous response to all queries, inquiries, 
                    and complaints; and Constantly developing new and smarter mechanisms to receive and address customer
                    grievances. The details of the dispute resolution mechanism are placed in the domain of public knowledge.
                    A dispute may occur as a result of several reasons. It may be because of the difference in the 
                    service expected and the service delivered. A dispute may also arise as a result of technical or
                    non-technical errors in the system or at times due to human inadvertence or error. SMART TRADERS TECHNOLOGIES
                    provides a user-friendly platform to all its customers to file a complaint/ share 
                    feedback if they are disappointed by the services rendered. Customers can give their complaint/
                    feedback in sending an email to [email protected] If the user's grievance is not resolved within 
                    the stipulated time frame, or if the user is not completely satisfied with the solution provided
                    by SMART TRADERS TECHNOLOGIES, then they can approach our dispute resolution system with their 
                    complaint or explore other legal avenues available for dispute resolution. To make SMART TRADERS dispute
                    resolution system more meaningful and effective, a structured system has been put in place. This
                    system will ensure that the complaints are redressed seamlessly and well within the stipulated
                    time frame.
